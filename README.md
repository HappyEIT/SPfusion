# SPfusion

In this project, we provide the more comprehensive Supplementary Materials for detailed illustrating (1) the sensitivity priors under the homogeneous distributions and inhomogeneous inclusions, (2) the settings of simulation training datasets, (3) the more visualization results and quantitative metrics of In-Distribution and Out-of-Distribution test datasets. This document is uploaded as a PDF file named 'TII_Supp Materials_SPfussion.pdf'. You can download it.
